# Security Labs Repository

This repository contains my security lab exercises, scripts, and notes.

## Structure

- `template-lab/` - Base folder to copy for new labs.
- `labs/` - Completed labs (lab01, lab02, ...).
- `tools/` - Reusable scripts and custom tools.
- `docs/` - General notes and reference material.

## Lab Folder Structure

Each lab folder contains:

- `notes.md` - Lab objectives, steps, commands, and observations.
- `scripts/` - Scripts used or developed for the lab.
- `results/` - Outputs, captures, or results from lab exercises (do not include sensitive data).

## Guidelines

1. Copy `template-lab/` for each new lab.
2. Use descriptive commit messages, e.g., `Lab01: Added nmap scanning scripts`.
3. Never store sensitive information such as real credentials.
4. Keep scripts runnable for reproducibility.
